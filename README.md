Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

software engineering is the design, development, deplyoing and testing of software in a structured and effecient manner which meets users problems or needs.
its importance is solving the every day world problems that human face through technology, ensuring high quality software, enhancing productivity, facilitating global connectivity through social networks and supports scalability.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

 The Birth of Software Engineering (1968 - NATO Conference)

 

 The Rise of Object-Oriented Programming (1980s - 1990s)

 The Advent of Agile Methodologies (2001 - Agile Manifesto)

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

structured way used to design, develop, test and maintain softwate, it involves planning, requirement analysis what does the user need and what does the system need , designing of the system how will it look and be viewed as , implemantation using code to run the system , testing making sure the commands and the user interface is working well,  deployment distributing or offloading to users  and maintance this is more of debugging and testing the software on regular.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall is best for projects with fixed, well-documented requirements and little expected change. best for banking and hospitals while agile is ideal for fast-changing, dynamic projects requiring continuous improvement and customer collaboration like mobile apps games and e commerce


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

software developer designs, develops, tests and maintains software, while quality assurance engineer is more on testing, debugging and maintaining the software with the project manager overseeing the entire project 


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

Provide a unified workspace for coding, debugging, and testing used in visual studio code while version control systems are used to track changes in source codes, allowing collaborations  examples being github


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

code bugs and debugging issues use automated testing and debugging tools , keeping up with the new technologies continous learning through online courses , tight deadlines use agile methadolgies and break down work into smaller work loads  


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

unit testing is to test individuals components of the software in isolation, intergration testing is to check if different modules work together, system testing is testing the entire application and acceptance testing is conducted by stake holders before deployment.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
 is the practice of designing clear, specific, and structured inputs to optimize the responses generated by AI models. It is crucial for:

Improving AI response accuracy and relevance.
Reducing misinterpretation and ambiguous outputs.
Enhancing user experience when interacting with AI systems.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

vague prompt tell me something about space improved tell me something interesting about planets and glaxies thatvery little people know about
